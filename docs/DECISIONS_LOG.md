# Decisions Log

## 2026-06-02 - v0.1 Documentation Foundation

- Decision: v0.1 is the active implementation scope.
- Decision: Sprint 1 is the active sprint.
- Decision: v0.2 docs and Sprint 7-12 artifacts remain future-only until v0.1 is complete.
- Decision: Zero-padded Markdown files are the canonical working docs/tasks for Sprint 1-6.
- Decision: No application code is created in Sprint 1 Task 1 because the repository is not empty and the task is documentation foundation.
- Decision: Next implementation task is minimum project setup for Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, and the intended repo structure.

## 2026-06-02 - Sprint 1 Initial Prisma Models

- Decision: Sprint 1 Task 6 implements only `User`, `Kingdom`, `District`, `ResourceStockpile`, `BuildingInstance`, `UnitStack`, `LandPurchaseCooldown`, and `Report`.
- Decision: Queue, tick, movement, combat, alliance, ranking, and full report-center models remain deferred to their owning v0.1 sprint tasks.
- Decision: The initial `User` model stores email/password and Google login fields directly with `passwordHash` and `googleSubject`; a separate auth account-linking model is deferred unless v0.1 needs it.
- Decision: The initial `AreaType` enum contains only `STANDARD`. Additional area categories can be added when v0.1 land pricing needs them; area-type bonuses remain post-v0.1.
